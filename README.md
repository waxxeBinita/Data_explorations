# Data_explorations
Exploration A
The company who supplied the Products data in the lecture notes also want an investigation into their website. 
The data is in a similar format to the Products, showing the number of page hits per day, rather than the number of product sales, 
but there are many more web pages than products.

All of the examples download their data from https://tinyurl.com/ChrisCoDV which links to a github repository,
https://github.com/ChrisWalshaw/DataViz.
